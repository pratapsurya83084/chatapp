Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React applications. It's created by the same team behind Jotai and React Spring, aiming to simplify global and shared state management.

üîç What is Zustand?
Type: State management library for React

Size: Very small (under 1kB gzipped)

API Style: Hook-based

Storage: Uses native JavaScript objects, not Redux-style reducers

No Boilerplate: No need for actions, reducers, or context providers

‚úÖ Why Use Zustand?
Minimal Setup
Create a store in a single line and start using it immediately ‚Äî no boilerplate, no context wrapper.

Simple API
Zustand uses plain JavaScript functions and the React hook system ‚Äî making it intuitive and easy to adopt.

Fast and Efficient
Updates are scoped to only the components that use the changed state (fine-grained reactivity).

Scalable
Good for both small apps and large-scale projects with complex state needs.

No Context Required
Unlike React Context, Zustand doesn't trigger unnecessary re-renders in all consumers when state changes.

Persist, Middleware, and More
Zustand has built-in support for persistence (e.g., localStorage), middleware (e.g., logging, devtools), and asynchronous logic.
